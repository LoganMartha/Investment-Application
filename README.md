# Airgead Banking App Project

This application focuses on **investing** and demonstrates the power of **compound interest**. It allows users to visualize how their investments will grow over time, making financial concepts accessible regardless of the user's prior investment experience.

## Project Highlights

- Delivered a **clean and readable output** that simplifies complex investment calculations for all users.
- Developed functionality to calculate and display the growth of investments with compound interest over time.
- Improved my use of **functions** to keep the `main` function concise and organized, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
- Focused on translating accurate mathematical calculations into code, which was the most challenging part of the project.

## Lessons Learned

- Planning and breaking down complex calculations before coding helps avoid confusion and improves code clarity.
- Practicing good coding style and **consistent formatting** is essential for maintainability and teamwork.
- Reducing the size of the `main` function by modularizing code into smaller functions significantly improves readability.
- Continued practice and repetition are key to advancing programming skills.
